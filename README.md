# excalidraw-gallery

## What is this

This is an experimental tool to show
[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) drawings.

## How to use it

1. Create a Google Spreadsheet
2. In the sheet, copy&paste Excalidraw shareable links
3. Open <https://dai-shi.github.io/excalidraw-gallery/>
4. Enter the spreadsheet URL and click "Open"

If the spreadsheet is publically readable,
it will show the table with previews (which are animatable!).
If the spreadsheet is private, you would see a Google Sign-in
popup to login. (Notice, this app is not verified by Google.)
